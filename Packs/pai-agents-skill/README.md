# PAI Agents Skill

> Dynamic agent composition system - create specialized agents with unique personalities and voices, composed from traits on-the-fly

> **Installation:** This pack is designed for AI-assisted installation. Give this directory to your AI and ask it to install using the wizard in `INSTALL.md`. The installation dynamically adapts to your system state. See [AI-First Installation Philosophy](../../README.md#ai-first-installation-philosophy) for details.

## The Problem

AI agent systems typically offer one-size-fits-all agents. You spawn "an agent" but they all have the same personality, same approach, same voice.

**Cognitive Monoculture:**
- Every analysis comes from the same perspective
- No natural devil's advocacy or alternative viewpoints
- Blind spots become systematic

**Lack of Specialization:**
- A security review agent should think differently than a creative brainstorming agent
- Generic agents lack focused expertise and behavioral patterns
- "Jack of all trades" means master of none

**Voice Confusion:**
- When multiple agents speak, they're indistinguishable
- No personality differentiation in outputs

## The Solution

### Hybrid Agent Model

Two types of agents working together:

| Type | Definition | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Named Agents** | Persistent identities with backstories | Recurring work, voice output, relationships |
| **Dynamic Agents** | Task-specific specialists composed from traits | One-off tasks, novel combinations, parallel work |

### Trait Composition System

Agents are composed by combining three trait categories:

```
AGENT = Expertise + Personality + Approach
```

**Expertise (10 types):** security, legal, finance, medical, technical, research, creative, business, data, communications

**Personality (10 dimensions):** skeptical, enthusiastic, cautious, bold, analytical, creative, empathetic, contrarian, pragmatic, meticulous

**Approach (8 styles):** thorough, rapid, systematic, exploratory, comparative, synthesizing, adversarial, consultative

**Total combinations:** 10 x 10 x 8 = **800 unique agent compositions**

### Voice Mapping

Each trait combination maps to a distinct voice automatically.

## Example Usage

```bash
# Infer traits from task
bun run AgentFactory.ts --task "Review this security architecture"
# Result: security + skeptical + thorough agent with appropriate voice

# Specify explicitly
bun run AgentFactory.ts --traits "legal,meticulous,systematic"
# Result: Legal expert with careful systematic approach

# List all traits
bun run AgentFactory.ts --list
```
